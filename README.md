# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Delay Prediction Web App (ML + Flask + MySQL)
This project is a machine learning-based Flask web application that predicts whether a flight will be delayed and estimates the delay duration (in minutes). The system also includes secure user authentication (login/signup), integrates with a MySQL database for user management, and loads a pre-trained PyTorch model to make real-time predictions.

## Problem Statement
Flight delays are a major inconvenience to passengers and a challenge for airlines. Predicting delays in advance can help in better planning and customer satisfaction. This application aims to:

Predict whether a flight will be delayed or not.

If delayed, predict how many minutes it might be delayed.

## Application Features
üîê User Authentication

Login / Signup / Logout

Passwords hashed and stored using Werkzeug + SQLAlchemy

üìà Prediction Interface

Users can input flight data to get predictions

Displays prediction results with context

üíæ Database Integration

Backend powered by MySQL

User data stored in a users table
